# Machine Learning for NLP course

This repo contains practical examples and exercises that will be used throughout the course.


## Background

This course is a excerpt of the first set of lectures given at Lisbon Machine Learning Summer School (LxMLS). The goal is to provide a theoretical revision of ML alongside practical implementations, moving from shallow linear models, such as CRFs and SVMs, to modern deep learning models, such as recurrent and self-attention networks. In the end of the course, students will be able to understand modern deep learning architecures and write powerful state-of-the-art models via transfer learning using PyTorch.

## Preparing the environment

If you are a Mac/Linux user, you can proceed with:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate 
pip3 install -U pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
jupyter-notebook
```

If you are a Window user, the above command might not work. In this case, install Miniconda:
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/

And then proceed with:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ml-for-nlp-course
jupyter-notebook
```
